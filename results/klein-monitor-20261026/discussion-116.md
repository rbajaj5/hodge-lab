Partial update for `klein-coupled-character`: the original $q=1$, $A=X_0^3Y_0^3$ target is unchanged, and **step 23 remains unsolved**.

Two construction families now have explicit obstructions:

1. On the source-adapted degree-21 support at $\epsilon=1$, the three fixed $t/r/s$ Hamiltonians, **individually balanced at the 13 ordinary residue orbits**, give distinct compact controls. Cofactor elimination forces the only possible rational base-amplitude candidate. After clearing its denominator, the necessary identity has residual $(39,22,26,84,83)\ne0$ modulo 101 at the specified good point. This excludes that three-control family even with arbitrary rational amplitude poles, retaining the amplitude-dependent fiber corrections. Pointwise first-jet surjectivity did not give a rational solution.

2. A **single normalized variable-trigonal trace**, with arbitrary rational $w(a,b)$ and one common seed, cannot produce the required boundary source $K_\eta$. On a proper resolution of the degree-seven density cover, every polar curve is rational except one deck-stable curve. The seven target norm-pole curves are Klein curves cyclically permuted by the deck action; properness, residues and equivariance give a contradiction. The weighted source is regular at infinity; that boundary was retained.

These conclusions exclude only the stated families. Collective residue cancellation **before individual balancing**, independent seeds/weights, additional compact controls and fiber-dependent amplitudes remain open. No full original $D/N/Q$ certificate or Lean proof has been obtained.
